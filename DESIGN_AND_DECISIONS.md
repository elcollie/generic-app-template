### [2025-04-24] Question Template Data Model & Topics Structure
**Context:**
Defined the data model for question templates and the structure for organizing them by topic and subtopic in Firestore. Added support for prerequisites and forward learning paths.

**Options Considered:**
- Flat question template structure with tags only
- Hierarchical structure with topics, subtopics, and prerequisite relationships

**Decision:**
Implement a persistent `topics` collection in Firestore for organizing templates by topic and subtopic. Each template references its topic and subtopic by ID and includes both `prerequisites` (topics/subtopics required before attempting) and `prerequisiteFor` (topics/subtopics this template unlocks). This supports curriculum navigation, adaptive learning, and future UI features.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Define Firestore collections and document structure for topics and templates
- [ ] Plan CRUD implementation for question templates
- [ ] Plan CRUD implementation for topics
